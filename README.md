# **Artisan Yarns**
Arts and crafts have always been a part of our lives and have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, not least for their well documented health benefits.

There is a great satisfaction to be gained from embarking on and completing a new project that reflects ones own personal style. (Not unlike coding).

*Artisan* Yarns is is a small e-commerce store for a hypothetical wool supply shop.  Whilst not a unique offering, it is my hope to further develop it after this course.

The demographic of those who knit and crochet goes well beyond the stereotypical grandparent!

Whilst most prefer the experience of going to a store and getting a feel for the goods, sometimes we just want the convenience of an online order delivered straight to our homes.

# **Planning Phase**
## **Strategy** 
### **Site Aims:**
As an *e-commerce* store, a few minimal requirements ought to be included. A user needs to:
- view the products being sold
- have a way to make a payment 
- be able to provide a delivery address.

To customise the user experience, could they save their details for future visits or see their own order history?

How could the store administer their inventory and update their product list and prices?

A *thought shower* with the above questions in mind can help identify desired store features and separate them into epics. 

### Opportunities:
(Scored from 1 minimum to 5 maximum)
Opportunity | Importance | Viability/Feasibility
---|---|---
Users can view all products | 5 | 5
Users can view products by category | 5 | 5
Users can view products by cost | 5 | 5
Users can view individual product details | 5 | 5
Users can search for a product by name / description using the searchbar | 5 | 5
Store owner can add a product | 5 | 5
Store owner can edit a product | 5 | 5
Store owner can delete a product | 5 | 5
Users can register for an account | 5 | 5
Users can login | 5 | 5
Users can logout | 5 | 5
Users can recover their password | 5 | 5
Users can edit their own unique profile | 5 | 5
Users can view items in their shopping basket | 5 | 5
Users can adjust the number of items by product line in their shopping basket | 5 | 5
Users can enter payment details to make a purchase | 5 | 5
Users can receive a confirmation email following their purchase | 5 | 5
Users can contact the site owners using a webform | 5 | 5
Totals | 90 | 90

User stories will closely follow the above opportunities.  Full disclosure, they have been identified in the *Boutique Ado* walkthrough project.

*Artisan Yarns* will draw quite extensively from the *Boutique Ado* codebase given current developer experience, a 7 week completion deadline and the common themes found on many e-commerce sites.

## **Scope**
The above oppurtunities should be prioritised by balancing completion effort and the importance/value of each desired feature.
User Design (UX) efforts can be categorized into *must*, *should* and *could have*.

**Must Have**
- Users can view all products
- Users can view individual product details
- Users can search for a product by name / description using the searchbar
- Store owner can add a product
- Store owner can edit a product
- Store owner can delete a product
- Users can register for an account
- Users can login
- Users can logout
- Users can edit their own unique profile
- Users can view items in their shopping basket
- Users can adjust the number of items by product line in their shopping basket
- Users can enter payment details to make a purchase

**Should Have**
- Users can view products by category
- Users can view products by cost
- Users can recover their password
- Users can receive a confirmation email following their purchase
- Users can contact the site owners using a webform

**Could Have**
- n/a

Exploring the scope shows the above features to be critical even for a basic e-commerce site.
