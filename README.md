# **Artisan Yarns**
Arts and crafts have always been a part of our lives and have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, not least for their well documented health benefits.

There is a great satisfaction to be gained from embarking on and completing a new project that reflects ones own personal style. (Not unlike coding).

*Artisan* Yarns is is a small e-commerce store for a hypothetical wool supply shop.  Whilst not a unique offering, it is my hope to further develop it after this course.

The demographic of those who knit and crochet goes well beyond the stereotypical grandparent!

Whilst most prefer the experience of going to a store and getting a feel for the goods, sometimes we just want the convenience of an online order delivered straight to our homes.

# **Planning Phase**
## **Strategy** 
### **Site Aims:**
As an *e-commerce* store, a few minimal requirements ought to be included. A user needs to:
- view the products being sold
- have a way to make a payment 
- be able to provide a delivery address.

To customise the user experience, could they save their details for future visits or see their own order history?

How could the store administer their inventory and update their product list and prices?

A *thought shower* with the above questions in mind can help identify features of the store and separate them into epics.
